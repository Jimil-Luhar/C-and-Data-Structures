# C and Data Structures

*A thrilling tale of logic, loops, and lost semicolons*



##
*Welcome to my curated chaos of C programming and Data Structures!*. This repository is a collection of all the codes I wrote while learning the fundamentals of C and data structures during my second year of engineering. Nothing too fancy â€” just practical, straight-to-the-point code snippets, neatly organised and written with love.


## ğŸ’¡ Why Does This Repo Exist?
To be honest? So I wouldnâ€™t forget everything two weeks after finals.
But also:
##### -->To help fellow students who wonder, "Is it just me, or does this pointer thing hate me too?"
##### -->To remind myself how far Iâ€™ve come (and how far I still have to go).
##### -->Because GitHub looks better when itâ€™s not empty.




## ğŸ‘€ Final Words
Feel free to fork, star, or steal inspiration (ethically).


-->Just remember: bugs are features in disguise, and semicolons are not optional.
